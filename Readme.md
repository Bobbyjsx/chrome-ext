# Chrome Screen Recorder Extension

This Chrome extension is developed using vanilla HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, making use of the Chrome API.

## Getting Started

To begin, install all the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Open [your chrome extensions](chrome://extensions/) in your browser to load the extension from your local machine.
if link is broken, just type this in your browser #chrome://extensions/

In the top left corner of your screen, you will find a 'Load Unpacked' button. Click on it and locate the extension directory on your machine.

## Note

Please note that the API for this extension is no longer active due to associated costs. However, you are welcome to play around with your own backend. Check out the commented code at [`content.js line 151`](https://github.com/bobbyjsx/chrome-ext/blob/main/content.js) to gain a better understanding of the interaction between the extension and the web page.
